Create a String indexer with method int[] Index(string input)

return an empty array if the input is null
return an empty array if the input is empty
the index array should have the same number of elements as the input
the index array values should default to 0
the first value of the index array should always be -1
the second value of the index array should always be 0

when an input character is one position to the right of a character that is the same as the input character at that characterâ€™s corresponding index value then its corresponding index value should be 1 + the index value of the character to its left
example:
input = "aab"
output = [-1,0,1]
    output[0] is -1 // rule 5
    output[1] is 0  // rule 6
    output[2] is 1  // rule 7 because input[2-1] == input[output[2-1]] => input[1] == input[0] => 'a' == 'a'
example:
input = "abcabda"
output = [-1,0,0,0,1,2,0]
    output[0] is -1 // rule 5
    output[1] is 0  // rule 6
    output[2] is 0  // rule 4
    output[3] is 0  // rule 4
    output[4] is 1  // rule 7 because input[4-1] == input[output[4-1]] => input[3] == input[0] => 'a' == 'a'
    output[5] is 2  // rule 7 because input[5-1] == input[output[5-1]] => input[4] == input[1] => 'b' == 'b'
    output[6] is 0  // rule 4
